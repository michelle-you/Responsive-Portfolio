      <p>Michelle is currently a Full Stack Web Development student at UCLA Extension. She received her Bachelor's degree at UCLA where she was a Pre-Med Anthropology major studying a combination of science and the evolution of human cultures and behaviors. While at UCLA, she volunteered in a Breast Cancer Research Lab at the UCLA Medical School where she co-authored multiple science publications before graduating in 2016.</p>

      <p>Her interest in switching career paths from becoming a doctor to programmer began after she decided to take her first computer science class, the beloved Java, just for fun. After that, she slowly started to learn more about coding in her free time leading up to her decision to commit to a the UCLA Extension bootcamp in November 2018. </p>

      <p>In her free time, Michelle likes to hang out in bookstores and ride her 600cc supersport motorcycle. </p>
