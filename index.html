      <p>Michelle is currently a Full Stack Web Development student at UCLA Extension. She received her Bachelor's degree at UCLA where she was a Pre-Med Anthropology major studying a combination of science and the evolution of human cultures and behaviors. While at UCLA, she volunteered in a Breast Cancer Research Lab at the UCLA Medical School where she co-authored multiple science publications before graduating in 2016.</p>

      <p>Her interest in switching career paths from becoming a doctor to programmer began after she decided to take a class on the beloved Java programming language just for fun. After that, she slowly started to learn more about coding in her free time leading up to her decision to commit to the UCLA Extension bootcamp in November 2018. </p>

      <p>Michelle has 7 years of experience playing Flute. She is also fluent in English and Khmer and has a basic understanding of French and Spanish having taken courses in both languages. In her free time, she likes to play piano, hang out in bookstores and ride her 600cc supersport motorcycle. </p>
